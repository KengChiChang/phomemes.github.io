We invite both long- and short-form papers. These papers will be archived in ICWSM's workshop proceedings unless authors request otherwise.

Topics include:

- Analysis of different types of images (photos, memes, cartoons, etc),
- Impacts of variation in image types on political mobilization,
- Use of screenshots to circumvent platform moderation,
- Identifying symbols of hate in online discourse, 
- Image appropriation for anti-social messaging,
- Characterizing similar images,
- Integrating message context with visual media,
- Use of images across multiple platforms, 
- Images and misinformation,
- Images as disinformation-campaign vectors, and
- Subtle symbols embedded in images.

Papers should be submitted through [EasyChair](http://easychair.com) and use the [AAAI author kit](https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit22.zip).

The workshop invites authors to submit three types of papers:

- Core Researcher Papers (8+ pages)
- Work-in-Progress Papers (&lt;4 pages)
- Practitioner Papers (1-2 pages)

Core research papers must contain novel, previously-unpublished material related to the topics of the workshop. Accepted papers will be presented orally and will appear in the workshop proceedings.
Work-In-Progress papers are shorter and meant to describe smaller, more focused research findings or research that is still in progress. Both of these paper types undergo a rigorous peer-review process and will be archived in the workshop proceedings, unless otherwise asked by the authors.

Practitioners are also invited to submit core and work-in-progress papers, but we recognize that academic review may not be appropriate for practitioner contributions. 
These authors may instead submit a brief 1-2-page paper that will not be included in the proceedings. 
We encourage submissions describing real-world experiences and case studies of interest to the workshop audience.
These submissions will be reviewed according to relevance and ability to contribute to discussions.
